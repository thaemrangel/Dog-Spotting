*Hello, this is a challenge project initiality made in 2021, with some obligatory steps (such as the use of vuetify). <br> Now, I'm thinking about updating it with some new components, and stuff, as a means of stuyding things I didn't knew at the time (such as vue compartimentalization) and unit testing.*

*You can pick a type of dog-breed and see pictures of them based on that. üêæ*
